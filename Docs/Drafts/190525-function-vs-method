NOTE ”FUNCTION” VERSUS “METHOD”

Sometimes the term “function” is used, and sometimes the term “method” is used. A function’s meaning implies that it returns a value and doesn’t modify anything in the system.

You can say a function is the ”read” part of the system. This is what is still used in functional languages such as F#, in which immutable data structures are popular.

A method does enable data modification and doesn’t return any data. This is the ”write” part of the system.

You can see this distinction in the Func<T> and Action types that were added to the .NET Framework. Func<T> always has a return type, whereas Action returns nothing.

In C#, this distinction is not used. The preferred term is “method.”
